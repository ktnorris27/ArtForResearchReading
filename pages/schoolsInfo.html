        <p>Art For Research Reading is an exciting opportunity for your pupils to have their artwork reviewed by an expert
          panel of judges and exhibited in public, while raising money for Cancer Research UK's Children & Young People campaign,
          which aims to accelerate progress, find new cures and kinder treatments for children’s cancers.</p>

        <p>The competition will run annually from the beginning of the new academic year (2020/21). Each year the
            Art For Research Reading committee will decide on a theme for the competition and work with schools to encourage children and
            young people, aged between 4 and 14 years, including those students with additional needs, to create and
            submit a picture inspired by the theme.  Artwork can be completed in school as part of the curriculum,
            an extra-curricular club or outside of school as homework.</p>

        <p>For 2020/21, the theme will be ‘<strong>The Environment</strong>’.</p>

        <p>To participate, we ask that each student donate <strong>£2</strong> to Cancer Research UK. Art For Research Reading volunteers
            will work with schools to collect pupils’ artwork for judging (January 2021). </p>

        <p>An expert panel of judges will then review the artwork, selecting entries from each participating school
           to exhibit as well as winners and runners up for each age and SEN category. Please refer to the
          <a href="#" onclick="onNavLinkClick(this); return false;" data-page="rules">Rules</a> for Art For Research for more details.</p>

        <p>The Art For Research Reading exhibition will take across two days, with a private opening and prize presentation for families, friends, school representatives and event sponsors
          and opportunities for members of the public, schools and local community groups to view the exhibition. There
          will be an opportunity for families to purchase their child’s artwork, with all money raised going to Cancer Research UK's Children & Young People campaign.</p>

        <p>We would be delighted if your school could provide an opportunity for your pupils to get involved in this exciting
          art competition and fundraising venture. Please register your interest in participating in Art For Research Reading using the button below.</p>
