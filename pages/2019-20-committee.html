          data-content="I have worked in clinical research for over 17 years predominantly in oncology. I am a cancer
          survivor and advancing science and medicine to make cancer a more manageable disease is so important to me.
          I grew up surrounded by art (my father was an architect and amateur sculptor) and believe strongly in local
          communities for which children and young people are the heart of.  I am therefore very honoured and excited
          to lead the committee, in bringing Art For Research to Reading, whilst raising critical funds for Cancer Research
          UK for their vital research.">

          Art For Research Reading is an amazing opportunity for me to put my experience toward a community project that
          encourages involvement in the arts for Reading children, in aid of a cause that is very close to my heart.
          I lost my mum to breast cancer at 16 so I know how devastating this disease can be to families.">
